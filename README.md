- Hi, Iâ€™m Nicholas Boo-Rivera.
- Iâ€™m interested in mainly running, puzzle solving, and gaming.
- Iâ€™m currently learning topics in electrical engineering, maybe in the future I will dive into advanced mathematics.
- I'm originally from Malaysia, but I was raised on the Big Island.
- I'm a Junior in electrical engineering.
- I chose my major because it has been something I have been interested in since 4th grade. 
- A fun fact about me is:  I can solve a rubiks cube in under 15 seconds.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  How to use Linux in general and what I can use C and C++ for in the foreseeable future.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Killer Bean Forever(free on Youtube in 4K)
